# Contributing to DXKit

Thanks for your interest in improving `@vyuhlabs/dxkit`. DXKit is a Stop-gate
for autonomous coding loops: it baselines a repo's current findings and blocks
only the net-new ones a change introduces. The same deterministic core runs
health, security, test-gap, code-quality, and dev-activity analyses against any
codebase, and generates `.claude/` agents, commands, skills, and rules tuned to
whatever language and framework you're working in.

`templates/` is generated — never edit it directly. Edit `src-templates/`
and run `npm run build`.

A note on the SDK boundary: anything exported from `packages/dxkit-sdk` is
contract (additive-only within its major, pinned by
`test/sdk-surface-freeze.test.ts` and architecture Rule 18). If your change
touches a frozen shape, the change belongs IN the SDK package with a
matching freeze-test update and changelog entry; a parallel definition in
`src/` fails the architecture gate. The SDK imports nothing from `src/`,
ever.

## Local development

```bash
nvm use                # picks up .nvmrc (Node 22)
npm ci                 # bit-exact install from package-lock.json (recommended)
npm run build          # copies src-templates/ → templates/ and runs tsc
npm test               # vitest in watch mode
npm run test:run       # build + vitest run (one-shot, includes integration)
npm run test:coverage  # build + vitest run --coverage (~34s, what pre-push runs)
npm run test:integration   # only test/integration/** (~33s alone)
npm run lint           # eslint
npm run format         # prettier --write .
```

`npm ci` is the recommended install command — it reproduces `package-lock.json`
exactly and matches what CI runs (`.github/workflows/ci.yml:20`). Use
`npm install <pkg>` only when intentionally adding or changing a dependency.
Avoid `--legacy-peer-deps` — the lockfile resolves cleanly without it; the
flag can silently drift versions in `package.json` during install.

The first `npm install` registers husky hooks automatically:

- **pre-commit:**
  1. `scripts/check-architecture.sh` — enforces CLAUDE.md's 18 architecture rules
  2. `scripts/check-slop.sh` — blocks new `console.log`, `: any`, `debugger;`,
     committed `.pyc`/`.swp`, etc. Add `// slop-ok` or `# slop-ok` inline to
     suppress individual lines.
  3. `lint-staged` — `eslint --fix` and `prettier --write` on staged files
  4. `tsc --noEmit` — typecheck the whole project
- **pre-push:**
  1. `npm run build` — ensure `dist/` is current
  2. `vitest run --coverage` — full suite + coverage report
  3. `scripts/check-coverage.sh` — fails if line coverage below threshold
     (default `DXKIT_COVERAGE_THRESHOLD=50`; set the env var to override
     locally)

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) on every PR runs the same checks the local
hooks run, plus:

- Lint with `--max-warnings 0`
- Slop check in "vs base branch" mode (`DXKIT_SLOP_BASE=origin/<base_ref>`),
  so `--no-verify` can't ship code that introduces slop
- `npm pack --dry-run`

Anything the local hooks let through, CI catches.

To try the analyzers against the repo itself:

```bash
vyuh-dxkit tools install --yes         # first-time: install cloc, gitleaks, etc.
node dist/index.js health --detailed
node dist/index.js test-gaps
node dist/index.js quality
```

To try `init` against a sample repo:

```bash
mkdir /tmp/dxkit-smoke && cd /tmp/dxkit-smoke && git init -q
node ~/projects/dxkit/dist/index.js init --detect
ls .claude/
```

## Adding a new agent

1. Create a markdown file in `src-templates/.claude/agents/<name>.md` (or in
   `agents-available/` if it should be opt-in).
2. Use the existing agents as a structural reference — frontmatter with
   `name`, `description`, `tools`, plus the system prompt body.
3. Run `npm run build` and verify the new file lands in `templates/.claude/agents/`.
4. Add an entry to `CHANGELOG.md` under `[Unreleased]`.

## Adding a new command

1. Create the file in `src-templates/.claude/commands/<name>.md`. Use the
   `.md.template` extension if the command body needs variable substitution
   at `init` time (see `template-engine.ts` for available variables).
2. Build and confirm it appears in `templates/.claude/commands/`.

## Adding a new rule (path-scoped)

1. Add a file under `src-templates/.claude/rules/<lang-or-framework>/<name>.md`.
2. Rules are matched by `detect.ts` based on what the target repo contains —
   if you're adding rules for a brand-new framework, add detection logic there
   too.

## Adding analyzer functionality

### Adding a new tool to the registry

1. Define the tool in `src/analyzers/tools/tool-registry.ts` under `TOOL_DEFS`:
   binaries to look for, install commands per platform (macos/linux/windows),
   `for: 'node' | 'python' | ...`, `layer: 'universal' | 'language' | 'optional'`.
2. If the tool is a Node package without a CLI binary (e.g. a vitest plugin),
   set `nodePackage: '@scope/pkg'` instead of listing `binaries`.
3. Add it to `buildRequiredTools()` in the same file so the detected stack
   picks it up.
4. Write a gather function that calls `findTool()` / `runRegisteredTool()` —
   never hardcode binary paths.

### Adding a new analyzer dimension

Today's shape: one directory under `src/analyzers/<name>/` with `types.ts`,
`gather.ts`, `actions.ts`, `detailed.ts`, and `index.ts`, plus a declarative
scoring spec at `src/scoring/dimensions/<id>.ts` (Rule 7 — analyzer subdirs
must NOT carry a `scoring.ts`). Wire the entry function into `cli.ts`. See
[Adding a new dimension scoring spec](#adding-a-new-dimension-scoring-spec)
for the full recipe.

### Adding a new language

Adding a language follows a **7-file recipe**. The scaffolder writes
most of it for you:

```bash
npm run new-lang kotlin "Kotlin (Android)"
```

The scaffolder creates **6 new files** (Recipe v2, Phase 10j.1):

```
src/languages/<id>.ts                  # pack stub — every LanguageSupport field with TODO markers
test/languages-<id>.test.ts            # parser-test stubs + fixture-loading helper + provenance docstring
test/fixtures/benchmarks/<id>/README.md # standard 5-file convention + TODO checklist
test/fixtures/raw/<id>/HARVEST.md      # commands to capture real tool-output bytes
src-templates/.claude/rules/<id>.md    # Claude rule file stub
```

And **updates 2 existing files**:

```
src/types.ts                           # extends LanguageId union with <id>
src/languages/index.ts                 # imports + registers <id> in LANGUAGES
```

Then you fill in the TODOs. The scaffolder prints a checklist of the
remaining work — including the critical Recipe-v2 step **#4: harvest
real tool output**.

**Parser test conventions — two classes, two rules** (Recipe v4
G_v4_1, refined from 10k.2.3 surfacing). The scaffolded
`test/languages-<id>.test.ts` is split into Section A and Section B
that codify these explicitly; the rules are:

1. **Source-text parsers** (`extract<X>ImportsRaw`, `map<X>Severity`,
   anything reading source code or severity-string mappings) →
   **synthetic inline strings**, no fixture file. Language syntax is
   stable; real fixtures add toil without catching bugs at this layer.

2. **Tool-output parsers** (`parse<X>LintOutput`,
   `parse<X>CoverageOutput`, `parse<X>DepVulnsOutput`, anything
   reading JSON/XML/text from an external tool) → **REAL fixture
   file** under `test/fixtures/raw/<id>/`. Capture commands live in
   that dir's `HARVEST.md`. The C# defect (Phase 10h.6.8 — parser
   passed synthetic-JSON unit tests for 5 months while returning 0
   findings on real `dotnet list package --vulnerable` output) is
   the cautionary tale that justifies this discipline.

The split matters because the failure modes differ: source-text
parsers fail when language grammar changes (rare, loud); tool-output
parsers fail when the upstream tool ships a schema tweak (frequent,
silent). Real fixtures defend against the latter.

#### What the pack declares (`LanguageSupport`)

All non-required fields can be omitted; the dispatcher tolerates it.
Required = `id`, `displayName`, `sourceExtensions`, `testFilePatterns`,
`detect`, `tools`, `semgrepRulesets`. Recommended (LP-recipe enforcement
will fail CI if missing):

- **Detection + source** — `detect(cwd) → boolean`, `sourceExtensions[]`,
  `testFilePatterns[]` (use `tests/<glob>` for path-anchored patterns,
  bare globs for basename match), `extraExcludes?[]`
- **Tool wiring** — `tools[]` (TOOL_DEFS keys this pack uses; the
  contract test verifies every `findTool(TOOL_DEFS.X)` reference in the
  pack's source appears here, AND every entry here is referenced
  somewhere — the artifact-generating allowlist covers exceptions like
  `coverage-py` and `cargo-llvm-cov`)
- **Capabilities** — `capabilities?: { depVulns, lint, coverage,
imports, testFramework, licenses }`. Each is a `CapabilityProvider`
  with an async `gather(cwd)` method; return `null` when nothing to
  report. The dispatcher fans out across every pack. A `depVulns`
  provider MUST declare `manifestPatterns` (the incremental dep-audit
  skip reads them) and SHOULD declare `lockfilePatterns` — exact
  basenames marking an INDEPENDENT dependency-resolution root
  (`package-lock.json`, `Gemfile.lock`, `go.mod`). The dispatch then
  audits every nested root and merges, so a vuln added to a nested
  sub-project's lockfile is caught; a pack that omits it keeps
  root-only auditing. Lockfiles, not plain manifests: a workspace
  member / Maven module resolves from the root tree and is already
  covered by the root audit.
- **Correctness floor** (2.23) — `correctness?: CorrectnessProvider`,
  the loop-safety liveness gate ("does this change still compile, and
  do the tests it affects still pass?"). TWO pure command builders:
  `syntaxCheck(ctx)` (the cheap compile/parse check every language can
  give) and `affectedTests(ctx)` (the tests the change reaches — native
  impact-selection where the ecosystem supports it, else a coarser
  fallback with CI's `full` scope as the backstop). Each returns a
  `{ label, bin, args }` command or `null`. A pack NEVER shells out
  itself — the runner (`src/analyzers/correctness/run.ts`) executes the
  command and owns the fail-open (missing tool / timeout → skip) vs
  fail-closed (non-zero exit → block) policy. Optional today; the
  contract test requires BOTH builders if you declare it. See
  `typescript.ts` (`tsc --noEmit` + vitest/jest) and `python.ts`
  (`py_compile` + pytest) for worked examples, and CLAUDE.md Rule 15.
- **Lint gate** (3.0) — `lintGate?: LintGateProvider`, the pack's standard
  zero-config linter wired as an opt-in guardrail gate (a net-new lint error
  blocks; the repo's pre-existing lint debt is grandfathered). One pure builder
  `lintCommand(ctx)` returns `{ bin, args, parse, expectedExit? }` — where
  `parse` is a regex with named groups (`file`/`line`/`rule`/`message`) so the
  finding is LOCATED (per file+line) — or `null` when the linter isn't
  resolvable in the repo. A pack NEVER shells out itself; the check runner
  (`src/analyzers/custom-checks/run.ts`) executes it and folds output into
  `custom-check` findings, exactly like a user-declared check. 7 of 8 packs
  declare a real gate (see `typescript.ts` `TS_ESLINT_UNIX_PARSE`, `python.ts`
  `PY_RUFF_CONCISE_PARSE`, `csharp.ts` `CSHARP_MSBUILD_WARNING_PARSE`); Java
  ships a dormant provider (no single zero-config standalone linter). See
  CLAUDE.md Rule 17.
- **HTTP flow** (M6) — `httpFlow?: HttpFlowSupport` +
  `treeSitterGrammars?`, the UI→API flow extraction surface. The recipe
  is DECLARATION-ONLY — the one extractor
  (`src/analyzers/flow/extract.ts`) reads any grammar through the
  per-grammar shape table (`src/ast/grammar-shape.ts`) and is never
  edited for a language:
  1. Declare `treeSitterGrammars` (extension → logical grammar name —
     the wasm ships in `tree-sitter-wasms`). If the grammar has no
     shape row yet, add one row in `src/ast/grammar-shape.ts`; most
     grammars fit the shared callee-field factory (verify node/field
     names against a real parse first — an unverified row silently
     misreads trees).
  2. Fill the descriptor from the construct families in
     `HttpFlowSupport` (`src/languages/types.ts`): `clientCallees`
     (bare `fetch(url)`), `clientMethodCallees` (`recv.get('/x')`,
     with `bases` naming TRUSTED always-HTTP receivers whose dynamic
     URLs are disclosed rather than dropped), `routeDecorators`
     (`@get('/x')`), `routeMemberDecorators` (`@app.get('/x')`),
     `routePathDecorators` (`@app.route('/x', methods=[...])`),
     `routeRouterCallees` (`app.get('/x', handler)`), `routeCallees`
     (verb-less `path(route, view)` → method-agnostic `ANY` routes),
     `fileRoutes` (file-convention routing). Worked examples:
     `typescript.ts` (fetch/axios/Express/Next.js) and `python.ts`
     (requests/httpx/FastAPI/Flask/Django).
  3. Pin it: a pack test like `test/flow-extract-python.test.ts`, plus
     a fixture dir + flow row in `test/fixtures-analysis.test.ts`.

  `test/languages-contract.test.ts` loud-fails an httpFlow pack whose
  grammar is missing, unshaped, or whose descriptor is vacuous;
  `test/recipe-playbook.test.ts` proves extraction is descriptor-driven
  end-to-end with the synthetic pack.

- **Model schema** — `modelSchema?: ModelSchemaSupport` +
  `treeSitterGrammars?`, the data-model extraction surface behind the
  schema drift gate. Same DECLARATION-ONLY recipe as flow — the one
  extractor (`src/analyzers/model-schema/extract.ts`) reads any grammar
  through the model-shape table (`src/ast/grammar-model-shape.ts`):
  1. Declare `treeSitterGrammars`, plus a MODEL-shape row in
     `src/ast/grammar-model-shape.ts` if the grammar has none (class /
     field / heritage / tag syntax — verify every node and field name
     against a real parse first).
  2. Fill the descriptor from `ModelSchemaSupport`
     (`src/languages/types.ts`): `modelBaseClasses` (heritage markers),
     `weakModelBaseClasses` (too-generic names like `Base` — they mark a
     model only when a `fieldCallees` constructor corroborates),
     `modelDecorators` (`@Entity`, `@dataclass`), `structTagKeys`
     (Go-style tags), `fieldCallees` (ORM field constructors carrying
     type + optionality; `typeFrom: 'callee' | 'firstArg'`),
     `transparentTypeWrappers` (`Mapped[X]` → `X`), `typeAliases`, and
     `schemaSignals` for doctor discovery. Worked examples:
     `typescript.ts`, `python.ts`, `go.ts`. Recognition is
     PRECISION-FIRST: a missed model is a disclosed gap, a false model
     floods the drift diff — when unsure, leave it out; `schema.specs`
     is the honest fallback.
  3. Pin it: pack extraction tests + a model fixture/row in
     `test/fixtures-analysis.test.ts`, then real-repo-validate the wave
     (inventory accuracy, a mutation battery with exact expected drift
     classes, and a refactor-only battery that must produce ZERO
     findings).

  `test/languages-contract.test.ts` loud-fails a modelSchema pack whose
  grammar is missing, model-unshaped, or whose recognition set is
  vacuous; `test/recipe-playbook.test.ts` proves extraction is
  descriptor-driven end-to-end with the synthetic pack.

  **Design discipline for the declarative layers (flow + model schema):
  a framework surprise must land as a DESCRIPTOR capability, never an
  engine special case.** Every real-repo bug this gate's validation
  found was fixed by making the descriptor language richer
  (`weakModelBaseClasses`, `transparentTypeWrappers`, a three-valued
  optionality marker) — not by teaching the extractor about a framework.
  If you find yourself adding an `if` for your language inside
  `src/analyzers/flow/` or `src/analyzers/model-schema/`, the right fix
  is a new (or extended) descriptor field plus a synthetic-pack
  assertion, so every other pack inherits it.

- **Init metadata** (LP-recipe — needed by `vyuh-dxkit init` and
  `doctor`) — `permissions[]` (Bash entries for `.claude/settings.json`),
  `ruleFile?` (filename under `src-templates/.claude/rules/`),
  `cliBinaries[]` (commands `doctor` checks for), `defaultVersion?`,
  `versionKey?` (lookup key in `DetectedStack['versions']`; defaults
  to `id` — only override for legacy template-name compat)
- **Allowlist comment syntax** (2.6) — `commentSyntax: { lineComment,
blockCommentStart?, blockCommentEnd? }`. Drives inline allowlist
  annotation insertion (`<lineComment> dxkit-allow:<category>
reason="..."`). Hash-style (`#`) for python, ruby, shell;
  slash-style (`//` + `/* */`) for typescript, go, rust, csharp,
  kotlin, java. Without it, the inline-allowlist code path can't
  render correct comments for this language.
- **Lint severity** — `mapLintSeverity?(ruleId)` if your linter has
  rule IDs you can tier into critical/high/medium/low
- **Per-pack pattern registries** (CI-enforced; the contract test
  fails when missing):
  - `autogeneratedSourcePatterns?[]` (D028) — basename globs for
    auto-generated files (`*.designer.cs`, `*.pb.go`,
    `*Generated.java`). Excluded from source-file counts, lines-over-
    500 ranking, hot-files ranking.
  - `docCommentPatterns?[]` (D027) — POSIX-compatible regex strings
    for doc-comment markers (`///`, `/**`, `def __doc__`, etc.).
    Drives the Documentation dimension's `docCommentFiles` metric.
  - `tlsBypassPatterns?[]` (D034) — regex strings for TLS / cert-
    validation bypass idioms specific to this language's HTTP stacks
    (`ServerCertificateValidationCallback`, `InsecureSkipVerify`,
    `danger_accept_invalid_certs`, ...). Each match becomes a
    Security finding.
  - `clocLanguageNames?[]` (D073, 2.4.7) — the names cloc emits in
    its `--json` output for this pack (`['TypeScript', 'JavaScript']`
    for the typescript pack, `['C#']` for csharp, etc.).
    `gatherClocMetrics` filters its language summary + `totalLines`
    aggregation to the union of every active pack's declarations, so
    JSON/XML/CSV/Markdown stop deflating quality metrics.
  - `upgradeCommand?(name, version)` (G_v4_4, 2.4.7) — per-ecosystem
    package-upgrade template surfaced under "Remediation Commands"
    in the vuln scan. `dotnet add package`, `npm install`, `pip
install`, `cargo update`, `go get`, edit-pom for Maven,
    edit-Gemfile for Bundler. Required when the pack declares a
    `depVulns` capability.
  - `exportDetection?` (2.7) — declares this pack's reliability for
    detecting which symbols are exported / public. Drives the
    `exported` flag on per-node entries in `.dxkit/reports/graph.json`
    - the `vyuh-dxkit explore api-surface` query + the dashboard viz
      "exported only" filter. Three reliability tiers: `'full'` (TS
      `export`, Go capitalization, Rust `pub`, C# / Java / Kotlin
      `public`), `'partial'` (Python `__all__` + public-name
      heuristic), `'unreliable'` (Ruby metaprogramming defeats static
      analysis — api-surface excludes the pack with an explanatory
      note). Detection itself lives in
      `src/analyzers/tools/graphify-graph.ts` (Python script).

#### Recipe enforcement (runs in pre-commit + CI)

Three layers prevent recipe drift:

1. **Architecture greps** (`scripts/check-architecture.sh`) — fail when
   pack-coupling slips into non-pack code: hardcoded `IF_<LANG>`
   references, direct `config.languages.<id>` lookups outside the
   registry bridge, hardcoded `<lang>.md` rule-file strings.
2. **Pack contract tests** (`test/languages-contract.test.ts`) — fail
   when a pack omits required metadata (`permissions`, `cliBinaries`,
   `defaultVersion`) or when declared `tools[]` drift from actual
   invocations.
3. **Synthetic 6th-pack playbook** (`test/recipe-playbook.test.ts`) —
   injects a mock pack into the registry and asserts every
   pack-iterating consumer (generator, doctor, detect, project-yaml,
   constants, coverage dispatcher, generic, grep-secrets, tool-registry)
   picks up its contributions. Catches "the architecture stopped being
   pack-driven" regressions empirically.

#### What scaffolding can't do for you

The scaffolder gives you a stub. The substantive work is:

- Implement `detect(cwd)` against your ecosystem's manifest signals
- Implement at least one capability provider (start with `coverage` —
  usually the simplest; `depVulns` is the most valuable but most
  involved)
- Add `TOOL_DEFS` entries in `src/analyzers/tools/tool-registry.ts`
  for any external tool you call
- Populate `test/fixtures/benchmarks/<id>/` with a minimal real project
  containing the matrix-dimension content (vuln, secret, lint,
  duplication, untested file)
- Register the fixture in `test/integration/cross-ecosystem.test.ts`
  `BENCHMARK_LANGUAGES`
- Add the toolchain install to `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- Document the toolchain requirement in this file's
  [Toolchain requirements](#toolchain-requirements) table

Plan ~1 day of work for a desktop-style pack (Python/Go-shaped),
~1.5 days for mobile (Gradle/Xcode bootstrapping is more involved).

### Adding a new dimension scoring spec

dxkit's six dimension scores (Security, Code Quality, Tests,
Documentation, Maintainability, Developer Experience) are produced
by declarative `DimensionScoringSpec<T>` artifacts under
`src/scoring/dimensions/<id>.ts`, consumed by the shared evaluator
in `src/scoring/evaluator.ts`. Adding a 7th dimension follows the
same recipe used by language packs (see [Rule 7 in
CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md#7-dimension-scoring-lives-in-declarative-specs-under-srcscoring)).

#### What the spec declares

```typescript
import type { DimensionScoringSpec } from '../spec';

export interface NewDimScoreInput {
  /* whatever the dimension reads from gathered data */
}

export const NEW_DIM_SCORING_SPEC: DimensionScoringSpec<NewDimScoreInput> = {
  dimension: 'new-dim',
  methodology: 'iso-iec-25010-quality-characteristic-name',
  baseline: 100, // subtractive (recommended) — additive (0) also supported
  penalties: [
    {
      id: 'unique-penalty-id',
      describe: (i) => `human-readable reason citing input data`,
      applies: (i) => /* predicate */,
      delta: (i) => /* negative delta for subtractive, positive for additive */,
    },
    // ... one rule per violation class
  ],
  caps: [
    {
      id: 'unique-cap-id',
      tier: 'fixable-finding', // see CAP_TIERS taxonomy
      describe: (i) => `condition reason`,
      applies: (i) => /* predicate */,
    },
  ],
};
```

#### Recipe (5 steps)

1. **Create the spec file** at `src/scoring/dimensions/<id>.ts`.
   Cite the methodology source in the file's JSDoc + the
   `methodology` field. Add the citation to
   `src/scoring/STANDARDS.md` (Layer 1 if it's an open standard;
   Layer 3 with rationale if dxkit-specific).

2. **Register the spec** in `src/scoring/index.ts:SCORING_SPECS`.
   Export the spec + input type from the barrel.

3. **Build the adapter** at `src/analyzers/<dim>/shallow.ts`:

   ```typescript
   export function toNewDimScoreInput(input: ScoreInput): NewDimScoreInput {
     // map ScoreInput → NewDimScoreInput
   }

   export function scoreNewDimFromScoreInput(input: ScoreInput): { score: number } {
     return evaluateSpec(NEW_DIM_SCORING_SPEC, toNewDimScoreInput(input));
   }

   export function scoreNewDimDimension(input: ScoreInput): DimensionScore {
     const result = evaluateSpec(NEW_DIM_SCORING_SPEC, toNewDimScoreInput(input));
     return {
       score: result.score,
       maxScore: 100,
       rating: ratingFromScore(result.score),
       rawScore: result.rawScore,
       rawPenalty: result.rawPenalty,
       methodology: result.methodology,
       deductions: result.deductions,
       capsApplied: result.capsApplied,
       topActions: result.topActions,
       metrics: {
         /* dimension-specific renderer values */
       },
       details: `human-readable summary string`,
     };
   }
   ```

4. **Wire the dimension into the health rollup**:
   - `src/analyzers/health.ts` calls `scoreNewDimDimension(input)`
   - `src/analyzers/health/actions.ts:buildHealthPlans` adds an
     entry with `scoreNewDimFromScoreInput` for action ranking
   - `src/scoring/overall.ts:DIMENSION_WEIGHTS` + `DIMENSION_LABEL`
     get an entry; weights across all dimensions must sum to 1.0

5. **Tests**:
   - Spec-level: a unit test in `test/<dim>-scoring.test.ts`
     covering the penalty curves and cap predicates against
     synthetic `NewDimScoreInput` shapes
   - Registry-level: `test/scoring-playbook.test.ts` automatically
     picks up new specs through the `SCORING_SPECS` iteration —
     no edit needed there

#### Spec enforcement (runs pre-commit + CI)

`scripts/check-architecture.sh` bans the regression patterns:

- New `src/analyzers/**/scoring.ts` files (dimension scoring code
  lives in `src/scoring/dimensions/`, not analyzer subdirs)
- Hardcoded rating-band thresholds (`>= 80` etc.) in scoring-related
  code outside `src/scoring/thresholds.ts`
- Hardcoded cap-ceiling values (`35`/`40`/`65`/`75`/`79`) used as
  `score = N` / `final = N` outside the scoring module

Annotate `// scoring-spec-ok` on the violating line for justified
exceptions (CVSS risk-tier bands, coverage thresholds that
deliberately differ from rating thresholds, etc.).

#### What "actionable" requires

Renderers (`src/scoring/format.ts`, `src/cli.ts` health-markdown
section) read the structured `ScoreResult` fields directly:

- `deductions[]` — items the customer can fix; rendered as the
  per-dimension "Top actions" block
- `capsApplied[]` — binding cap with its uplift; rendered as a
  callout above the action list
- `rawScore` / `rawPenalty` — "severe debt" disclosure when the
  score floors at 0

If your spec is subtractive (baseline 100, deductions for missing
or problematic signals), the `deductions[]` list reads as
actions-to-take naturally. Additive specs (baseline 0, bonuses for
present signals) are supported but rarely the right choice — the
inverse "things to add" interpretation requires the renderer to
walk the spec rules separately. dxkit's six dimensions all use
subtractive specs as of 2.4.7.

### Enriching dependency-vulnerability severity

Scanners that don't publish per-finding severity tiers (pip-audit,
govulncheck) can be enriched via OSV.dev. The utility lives in
`src/analyzers/tools/osv.ts`:

```ts
import { enrichSeverities, classifyOsvSeverity } from '../analyzers/tools/osv';

// For per-ID lookup:
const severities = await enrichSeverities(['CVE-2025-X', 'GHSA-Y']);

// When the scanner already embeds the advisory (like govulncheck):
const sev = classifyOsvSeverity(embeddedOsvRecord);
```

Both paths handle CVSS v3, CVSS v4, and the `database_specific.severity`
string. Unreachable IDs fall back to `'unknown'` — callers should bucket
unknowns into their scanner's legacy default (pip-audit → medium,
govulncheck → high).

## Testing changes

Tests live in `test/` and use [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/). Three kinds:

- **Unit tests** (`test/*.test.ts`): exercise pure functions and single
  modules against fixtures or temp directories. Fast (<3s for the whole
  unit suite). Examples: `detect.test.ts`, `scoring.test.ts`,
  `coverage.test.ts`, `import-graph.test.ts`, `suppressions.test.ts`.
  Add fixtures under `test/fixtures/` when teaching `detect.ts` about a new
  language or framework.
- **Analyzer integration test** (`test/integration/analyzers.test.ts`):
  creates a minimal temp repo once, runs all 5 analyzers against it in
  `beforeAll`, and shares the reports across assertions. This is what
  gives us coverage of the shell-out code paths (gitleaks, jscpd, eslint,
  npm audit). ~18s. Included in the default suite.
- **Cross-ecosystem integration test** (`test/integration/cross-ecosystem.test.ts`):
  runs `dxkit vulnerabilities` against committed benchmark fixtures
  under `test/fixtures/benchmarks/{python,go,rust,csharp,csharp-multi}/`
  — projects with deliberately pinned vulnerable deps. Validates non-TS
  language packs against real ecosystem-tool output (pip-audit,
  govulncheck, cargo-audit, dotnet list package --vulnerable). ~150s
  end-to-end (subprocess-heavy; CI parallelizes). Each ecosystem's
  tests `skipIf` the relevant binary is not on PATH, so contributors
  without the toolchain see those tests skip locally; CI installs them
  all. See **Cross-ecosystem benchmarks** below.
- **CLI integration test** (`test/cli-init.test.ts`): builds the CLI and
  runs it against a temp directory, asserting on the files `init` writes.
  Use this when changing the generator.

Run the suite:

```bash
npm test                   # watch mode
npm run test:run           # one-shot (build + full suite)
npm run test:coverage      # + coverage + threshold check (~34s)
npm run test:integration   # only test/integration/** (~33s alone)
```

Integration tests require a built CLI — `npm run test:run` and
`npm run test:coverage` build automatically. `npm test` (watch mode) does
not; build manually if you're editing the CLI binary.

### Coverage expectations

- Keep dxkit's own line coverage above `DXKIT_COVERAGE_THRESHOLD` (default 50%).
  The pre-push hook and CI both enforce this.
- New analyzer modules should have unit tests before shipping — see the
  patterns in `test/scoring-dimensions.test.ts` (pure scoring), `test/
gather-tests.test.ts` (filesystem fixtures), and `test/actions-detailed.
test.ts` (report transformers).
- The integration test exercises the end-to-end pipeline; don't mock the
  analyzer internals in it. If you need isolated coverage for a gather
  function, write a unit test that drives the specific parser instead.

## Cross-ecosystem benchmarks

`test/fixtures/benchmarks/` holds five committed reference projects
(`python`, `go`, `rust`, `csharp`, `csharp-multi`) with deliberately
pinned vulnerable dependencies. They exist to validate dxkit's non-TS
language packs against **real** ecosystem-tool output rather than
hand-crafted JSON.

The history that motivated them: through 2.4.0, the Python / Rust / C#
packs were unit-tested only against synthetic JSON the test author
hand-wrote. Phase 10h.6.8 surfaced four real defects — including a
C# parser that returned **zero findings on every real .NET project**
because the synthetic fixture had the wrong schema shape and the
parser had drifted to match. The benchmarks are the regression net.

### Toolchain requirements

**Routine dxkit development does not require any of these toolchains.**
The cross-ecosystem suite uses `it.skipIf(!commandExists(...))(...)`
gates — locally, contributors without `cargo` / `dotnet` / `go` /
`govulncheck` / `pip-audit` see those tests skip with a clear message.
CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) installs them all; that's the
canonical validation point.

If you need to run the cross-ecosystem suite locally — e.g., because
you're modifying a non-TS language pack — install the relevant
toolchain:

### Regenerating a fixture

The fixtures are committed minus `obj/` (.NET build artifacts — see
`.gitignore` rule for `test/fixtures/benchmarks/**/obj/`). Most
fixtures need no regeneration; the cases that do:

```bash
# Rust — re-resolve dependency graph
cd test/fixtures/benchmarks/rust && rm Cargo.lock && cargo generate-lockfile

# Go — re-resolve module checksums (use `tidy`, not `download` — govulncheck needs transitive sums)
cd test/fixtures/benchmarks/go && rm go.sum && go mod tidy

# C# (single + multi) — restore is automatic in the integration test's beforeAll
# To regenerate locally for inspection:
cd test/fixtures/benchmarks/csharp && dotnet restore
cd test/fixtures/benchmarks/csharp-multi && dotnet restore Solution.sln
```

Each fixture has its own `README.md` documenting expected scanner
output and the specific defect it guards against.

### Running locally

```bash
# Full cross-ecosystem suite (will skip ecosystems whose toolchains are missing):
npm run test:run -- test/integration/cross-ecosystem.test.ts

# Single ecosystem:
npm run test:run -- test/integration/cross-ecosystem.test.ts -t Rust
```

Subprocess-heavy: ~150s wall-clock end-to-end. Each test invokes
`node dist/index.js vulnerabilities <fixture>` which in turn shells
out to the real ecosystem tool. CI parallelizes the matrix; locally
they run serially.

## Releasing

Releases are handled by the maintainers via GitHub Releases, which trigger
the publish workflow. Contributors do not need to bump versions in PRs.

Three packages release from this repo, each on its own tag namespace:
`vX.Y.Z` (the main package, `publish.yml`), `dxkit-sdk@vX.Y.Z`
(`publish-dxkit-sdk.yml`), and `create-dxkit@vX.Y.Z`
(`publish-create-dxkit.yml`). Ordering rule: when a main release raises its
`@vyuhlabs/dxkit-sdk` dependency floor, the SDK publishes first so the
dependency resolves on npm.

The SDK's publish is AUTOMATIC: bumping `packages/dxkit-sdk/package.json`
in a reviewed PR is the publish intent — once that bump reaches main with
green CI, `publish-dxkit-sdk.yml` creates the `dxkit-sdk@vX.Y.Z` tag +
Release and publishes (a version already on npm is a silent no-op). The
manual Release path stays for recovery re-runs, `publish.yml` refuses to
publish dxkit while its SDK dependency range does not resolve on npm, and
the release-prep architecture gate blocks a main version bump when SDK
content changed without an SDK version bump.

## Code style

- **Prettier** is the source of truth for formatting. Run `npm run format`
  before you commit, or let the pre-commit hook handle it.
- **ESLint** runs with `--max-warnings 0` in CI. Fix anything `npm run lint`
  reports — don't suppress with eslint-disable comments unless there's a
  real reason and you note it inline.
- **TypeScript** strict mode is on. `npm run typecheck` must pass.
- **No new runtime dependencies** without discussion — DXKit aims to stay
  zero-dep so it installs fast via `npx`.

A `.git-blame-ignore-revs` file is in the repo root to mask large
formatting commits from `git blame`. Configure your local git once:

```bash
git config blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs
```

GitHub's blame view honors this file automatically.
