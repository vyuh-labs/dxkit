/**
 * Types for the custom-check gate runner.
 *
 * A "custom check" is any repo command dxkit runs as a gate citizen: a
 * user-declared invariant from `.dxkit/policy.json:checks` (`check:seam`,
 * `make lint`, a license audit) OR a pack-declared built-in check (lint). Both
 * normalize to the SAME `CustomCheckSpec` and flow through the SAME runner, so
 * lint is not a parallel code path — it is the first built-in consumer of this
 * one seam.
 *
 * The runner turns each check's exit code + output into zero or more
 * `CustomCheckFinding`s, which the baseline producer maps to `custom-check`
 * baseline entries (identity in `finding-identity.ts`). From there they inherit
 * the whole native-finding machine: fingerprint, baseline, matcher, brownfield
 * classify, allowlist, guardrail verdict — so a PRE-EXISTING check failure is
 * grandfathered and only a NET-NEW one blocks/warns.

/**
 * How to turn a failing check's output into findings.
 *
 *   - `{ mode: 'exit' }` (default): BINARY. A non-`expectedExit` exit yields ONE
 *     finding for the whole check (identity = the check name). This is the
 *     `check:seam` / `check:platform` shape — a pass/fail command with no
 *     per-location parse. Its net-new appearance means "this command started
 *     failing".
 *   - `{ mode: 'regex', pattern }`: PARSED. Each output line matching `pattern`
 *     yields one located finding. The regex uses NAMED capture groups —
 *     `(?<file>…)`, `(?<line>…)`, `(?<rule>…)`, `(?<message>…)` — any subset;
 *     `file` present makes the finding located (per file+line+rule identity),
 *     which is what lets a net-new lint diagnostic block while the repo's
 *     pre-existing lint debt is grandfathered. A failing exit that produces zero
 *     regex matches falls back to one BINARY finding, so a failing check never
 *     silently yields nothing.
 *   - `{ mode: 'structured', label, parse }`: PARSED, from the tool's native
 *     machine-readable output (a pack lint gate's `LintOutputParse`). Only
 *     pack-declared lint reaches this mode — the policy JSON can express
 *     `exit` and `regex` only, so a user-declared check can never smuggle a
 *     function in. Same located semantics + binary fallback as `regex`.
 *     `label` names the format for recall/diagnostics (a function cannot be
 *     hashed).
