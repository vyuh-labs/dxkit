 * interprocedural engine like CodeQL produces — lives outside dxkit's
 * bundled toolchain. Rather than try to out-detect those engines,
 * dxkit *ingests* their output and makes it first-class: fingerprinted
 * (Rule 9), aggregated (Rule 8), baselined (Rule 10), graph-linked
 * (Rule 12), and fixable through the agent loop.
 *
 * Every supported engine funnels into the SAME normalized shape
 * (`ExternalFinding`) so the rest of the pipeline is engine-agnostic.
 * Adding an engine is a new *producer* (a function that returns
 * `ExternalFinding[]`); the normalize → aggregate → graph → fix path
 * never grows an engine-specific branch.

 * (OSS / GitHub Advanced Security), emitting SARIF.
 * - `semgrep-pro` — Semgrep Pro engine (interprocedural), if a

 * - `sonarqube` — SonarQube Server / SonarCloud, read from the Sonar
 * Web API (`api/issues/search`, quota-free; Sonar is
