## [Unreleased]

## [2.0.0] - 2026-04-22

**BREAKING RELEASE.** The deterministic analyzer architecture introduced in
1.6.0 matured through an explicit capability model during Phase 10e. Language
packs now expose data exclusively through typed capability providers
(depVulns, lint, coverage, testFramework, imports) routed through a
`CapabilityDispatcher`; global scanners (gitleaks + grep-secrets fallback,
semgrep, jscpd, graphify) register under the same model. The legacy
`gatherMetrics` channel and its aggregation helpers are removed.

### Breaking changes — JSON schema v10 → v11

- Detailed reports now emit `"schemaVersion": "11"` (was `"10c.1"`).
- `HealthReport.dimensions.*.metrics` shed all capability-data echoes
  (`lintErrors`, `lintWarnings`, `lintTool`, `secretFindings`,
  `depVulnCritical`/`High`/`Medium`/`Low`, `depAuditTool`,
  `testFramework`, `coveragePercent`, `commentedCodeRatio`,
  `maxFunctionsInFile`, `deadImportCount`, `godNodeCount`,
  `communityCount`, `avgCohesion`, `orphanModuleCount`). Consumers read
  these from `report.capabilities.*` now.
- `HealthReport.capabilities` is the new canonical sub-object carrying
  typed envelopes (`depVulns`, `lint`, `coverage`, `imports`,
  `testFramework`, `secrets`, `codePatterns`, `duplication`,
  `structural`).
- `HealthMetrics` narrowed to ~30 non-capability fields (filesystem
  counts, grep markers, doc / config flags, language breakdown).
- `QualityReport`, `SecurityReport`, `TestGapsReport`, `DevReport` shapes
  unchanged — their detailed variants still bump to v11 for release
  consistency.

### Added

- Capability dispatcher (`src/analyzers/dispatcher.ts`) with per-`(cwd,
  capId)` in-memory caching and provider-failure isolation.
- Nine capability descriptors with bespoke aggregate functions
  (depVulns/lint sum counts, coverage/testFramework last-wins,
  secrets/codePatterns union findings, duplication sums + re-weights,
  structural last-wins, imports unions per-pack graphs).
- Multi-provider support per capability: `GlobalCapabilities` slots take
  provider arrays, so fallbacks and opt-in scanners compose cleanly.
- `grep-secrets` fallback provider: 7 regex patterns (hardcoded-password,
  api-key, secret, private-key, AWS access key, GitHub token, Anthropic
  key) that activate when `gitleaks` is absent. Preserves degraded-
  environment secret coverage.
- `src/analyzers/tools/package-json.ts`: direct `fs.readFileSync` +
  `JSON.parse` helper for `npmScriptsCount` and `nodeEngineVersion`,
  replacing the prior `node -e` subprocess pair.

### Removed

- `LanguageSupport.gatherMetrics` optional method — every pack now
  exposes data through `capabilities`.
- `LangMetrics` type and `mergeMetrics` / `AGGREGATED_VULN_FIELDS`
  helpers.
- `gatherGitleaksMetrics`, `gatherGraphifyMetrics` legacy bridge
  functions (capability providers + memoized outcome helpers replace
  them).
- `getSemgrepRulesets`, `getToolDef`, `runRegisteredTool`,
  `EVOLVING_FILES`, `src/analyzers/index.ts` barrel file — all
  unreferenced after the refactor.
- Pre-2.0 child-process + bash orchestration in `tools/parallel.ts`;
  gitleaks and graphify now run in-process with per-cwd memoization.

### Changed

- Scorers consume a `ScoreInput = { metrics, capabilities }` bundle
  (was: flat `HealthMetrics`). Same byte-identical scoring formulas.
- `HealthReport.toolsUsed` synthesizes per-pack tool names
  (`eslint`, `npm-audit`, `ruff`, `pip-audit`, `golangci-lint`,
  `govulncheck`, …) directly from `capabilities.lint.tool` and
  `capabilities.depVulns.tool` rather than from the deleted per-pack
  gatherMetrics emissions.

### Migration

- Replace `report.dimensions.quality.metrics.lintErrors` →
  `(report.capabilities.lint?.counts.critical ?? 0) +
  (report.capabilities.lint?.counts.high ?? 0)`.
- Replace `report.dimensions.security.metrics.secretFindings` →
  `report.capabilities.secrets?.findings.length ?? 0`.
- Replace `report.dimensions.security.metrics.depVulnCritical` →
  `report.capabilities.depVulns?.counts.critical ?? 0` (and similarly
  for high/medium/low).
- Replace `report.dimensions.testing.metrics.coveragePercent` →
  `Math.round(report.capabilities.coverage?.coverage.linePercent ?? 0)`.
- Replace `report.dimensions.testing.metrics.testFramework` →
  `report.capabilities.testFramework?.name`.
- Replace `report.dimensions.quality.metrics.maxFunctionsInFile` →
  `report.capabilities.structural?.maxFunctionsInFile`.
- No changes required for non-`health` commands — `vyuh-dxkit
  vulnerabilities`, `test-gaps`, `quality`, `dev-report` keep their
  report shapes unchanged.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-04-18

This release transforms dxkit from a scaffolder into an analyzer-and-scaffolder.
Five native CLI commands run deterministic analyses against any repo — no LLM
required, reproducible scores, agent-consumable JSON output. The scaffolding
capability is unchanged.

### Added

#### Native analyzer CLI (new primary capability)

- **`vyuh-dxkit health [path]`** — 6-dimension score (Testing, Code Quality,
  Documentation, Security, Maintainability, Developer Experience) with
  overall grade A–F. Runs in 10–20s on mid-size repos.
- **`vyuh-dxkit vulnerabilities [path]`** — gitleaks secret scan + semgrep SAST
  + `npm audit` / `pip-audit` / `govulncheck` / `cargo-audit` dependency
  vulnerabilities. Findings grouped by rule with severity + CWE category.
- **`vyuh-dxkit test-gaps [path]`** — coverage artifact import with
  import-graph reachability fallback. Ranks untested files by risk tier
  (CRITICAL for auth/security, HIGH for large services, etc.).
- **`vyuh-dxkit quality [path]`** — Slop score (0–100) combining lint errors,
  `: any` density, console statements, TODO/FIXME, duplication % (jscpd),
  comment ratio, and hygiene markers. Ranked remediation actions.
- **`vyuh-dxkit dev-report [path]`** — git activity: commits, contributors,
  hot files, merge ratio, conventional-commit compliance, weekly velocity.
- **`--detailed` flag** on all analyzers — writes paired `<name>-detailed.md`
  + `<name>-detailed.json` with Evidence (file, line, rule, tool) and
  `RemediationAction<M>` entries ranked by projected score delta.
- **`--json` flag** — pure JSON on stdout, logs on stderr for clean piping.
- **`--verbose` flag** — per-tool timing to stderr.
- **`--no-save` flag** — skip markdown output.
- **`--since <date>`** (dev-report only) — bound the git activity window.

#### Tool registry and installer

- **`vyuh-dxkit tools`** — list detection status for all tools required by
  the detected stack. Multi-path detection (PATH → brew → npm-g → pipx →
  cargo → go → project `node_modules` → system probes).
- **`vyuh-dxkit tools install [--yes]`** — interactive or non-interactive
  install of missing tools via platform-specific commands (brew on macOS,
  user-local on Linux). No `sudo` required; tools install to `~/.local/bin`
  or equivalent.
- **21 tools integrated** across 6 languages:
  - Universal: `cloc`, `gitleaks`, `semgrep`, `jscpd`, `graphify`
  - Node/TS: `eslint`, `npm audit`, `@vitest/coverage-v8`
  - Python: `ruff`, `pip-audit`, `coverage` (coverage.py)
  - Go: `golangci-lint`, `govulncheck`
  - Rust: `clippy`, `cargo-audit`, `cargo-llvm-cov`
  - C#: `dotnet-format`
- **`nodePackage` field** on `ToolDefinition` — detects Node packages that
  have no CLI binary (e.g. vitest plugins) via `node_modules/<pkg>/package.json`.
- **`runRegisteredTool()`** — sanctioned path to run any registered tool,
  ensures all tool invocation goes through detection instead of hardcoded
  binary paths.

#### Coverage artifact import

- **Istanbul** (`coverage/coverage-summary.json` + `coverage-final.json`) —
  used by vitest, nyc, c8. Parses per-file line coverage + overall %.
- **coverage.py** (`coverage.json`) — Python.
- **Go coverprofile** (`coverage.out` / `cover.out`) — text format with
  module-prefix path resolution.
- **Cobertura XML** (`coverage.cobertura.xml`, `TestResults/<guid>/...`) —
  C# (coverlet) and Rust (`cargo llvm-cov --cobertura`).
- **lcov** (`lcov.info`) — Rust (`cargo llvm-cov --lcov`).

#### Import-graph test matching

- **TS/JS extractor** — static imports, `import(...)` dynamic, `require()`,
  `export * from` re-exports, multi-line imports, comment-stripping.
- **Python extractor** — `import X`, `from X import Y`, relative-dot imports.
- **Go extractor** — single-line `import "fmt"` + multi-line `import (...)`
  blocks with alias support. Module-based resolution via `go.mod`.
- **Rust extractor** — `use std::io`, nested paths, block `use std::{io, fs}`.
- **C# extractor** — `using X.Y;`, `using static`, `using Alias = X.Y;`.
- **Resolver** — relative-path resolution with extension fallback and
  directory-as-`index.ts` probing (TS/JS) or `__init__.py` (Python).
  Go resolves internal module paths via `go.mod` module prefix.
- **BFS walker** — up to 3 hops transitively, cycle-safe. External packages
  are correctly skipped.

#### Suppressions

- **`.dxkit-suppressions.json`** — silence known-false positives per tool
  without editing code. Format:
  ```json
  {
    "gitleaks": [
      { "rule": "generic-api-key", "paths": ["test/fixtures/**"], "reason": "..." }
    ]
  }
  ```
- Glob matcher supports `**`, `*`, `?`. A finding is suppressed when rule
  matches (exact or `*`) AND at least one path glob matches.
- Wired to gitleaks. Semgrep and slop-hook integrations follow.

#### CI + hooks hardening

- **CI enforces everything pre-push does, plus slop-vs-base diff.**
  `.github/workflows/ci.yml` now runs architecture check, slop check
  (diffing against the PR base branch via `DXKIT_SLOP_BASE`), tests with
  coverage, and coverage-threshold enforcement. `--no-verify` can no longer
  ship code that introduces slop.
- **`scripts/check-coverage.sh`** — reads `coverage/coverage-summary.json`,
  fails if line coverage below threshold (default 50%, configurable via
  `DXKIT_COVERAGE_THRESHOLD`). Wired into `.husky/pre-push` and CI.
- **`scripts/check-slop.sh` CI mode** — when `DXKIT_SLOP_BASE` env var is
  set, diffs against that ref instead of `--cached`. Pre-commit behavior
  unchanged.

#### Dogfood

- dxkit's own line coverage raised from ~19% to 59% in the course of
  building these analyzers. 423 tests across 21 files, all passing.
  Coverage threshold of 50% enforced on every push and PR.

#### Language-pack rearchitecture (10d.1.6)

- **`LanguageSupport` interface** — single-file-per-language architecture.
  Each language implements: detection, tool bindings, semgrep rulesets,
  coverage parsing, import extraction/resolution, metric gathering, and
  lint severity mapping. `src/languages/{python,typescript,csharp,go,rust}.ts`.
- **Registry dispatch** — `health.ts`, `tool-registry.ts`, `import-graph.ts`,
  `gather.ts`, and `quality/gather.ts` all dispatch through
  `detectActiveLanguages()` instead of per-language if-chains.
- **Old scattered code deleted** — `src/analyzers/tools/{node,python,go,
  rust,dotnet}.ts` removed (~583 LOC). Net reduction despite adding 5
  language packs + coverage parsers + import extractors.
- **Ruff severity mapping** — Python lint results now bucket ruff codes by
  prefix: S→critical, F/B→high, E/C→medium, W/N/D/I→low. Previously all
  results were counted as errors regardless of code.
- **C# `*Tests.cs` pattern** — test-gap analyzer now recognizes the C#
  naming convention (`FooTests.cs`, `Foo.Tests.cs`) that the old
  `*.test.*`/`*.spec.*`-only patterns missed.
- **`cargo-llvm-cov`** registered in TOOL_DEFS with detection + install.
- **Contract tests** — 46 tests validate every language pack: TOOL_DEFS
  key validity, extension format, wildcard patterns, detect() idempotency,
  completeness (all 5 required IDs registered).

#### OSV.dev severity enrichment + CVSS v4 (10d.2)

- **OSV.dev integration** — `src/analyzers/tools/osv.ts` looks up
  vulnerability IDs against `https://api.osv.dev/v1/vulns/{id}` and
  classifies them into critical/high/medium/low tiers. Session-scoped
  in-memory cache. 10s per-request timeout with offline fallback.
- **Full CVSS v4.0 calculator** — `src/analyzers/tools/cvss-v4.ts` with
  the 270-entry macrovector → base-score lookup table (BSD-2-Clause,
  ported verbatim from FIRST.ORG's reference implementation, attributed
  in `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`). Handles equivalence-class computation,
  severity-distance refinement, and rounding per spec. Critical for
  modern CVEs (2025+) that publish v4 vectors exclusively.
- **Python pack (`pip-audit`)** — previously bucketed every finding as
  medium. Now extracts vuln IDs and looks each up via OSV. Unknown or
  unreachable IDs keep the legacy medium bucket. Verified on
  CVE-2025-8869 (pip tar symlink → v4 5.9 → medium, matches NVD).
- **Go pack (`govulncheck`)** — ndjson findings reference OSV IDs.
  We now prefer the advisory's embedded severity (govulncheck inlines
  the full OSV record), only falling back to the OSV.dev API when
  severity data is missing. Unknown IDs bucket as high (govulncheck's
  legacy default).

#### Lint severity tiers across all packs

Each language pack now exposes `mapLintSeverity(ruleId)` that tiers
findings into critical/high/medium/low. `gatherMetrics` still collapses
to the legacy `lintErrors`/`lintWarnings` fields (critical+high →
errors, medium+low → warnings) for backcompat.

- **TypeScript (ESLint)** — security plugins (`security/*`,
  `security-node/*`) and code-injection built-ins (`no-eval`,
  `no-new-func`, `@typescript-eslint/no-unsafe-eval`) → critical;
  correctness bugs (`no-undef`, `no-unreachable`, `no-dupe-*`,
  `@typescript-eslint/no-unsafe-*`, `react-hooks/rules-of-hooks`) → high;
  best practices (`no-console`, `prefer-const`,
  `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any|no-unused-vars`,
  `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps`) → medium; style plugins
  (`prettier/*`, `import/*`, `react/*`, `jsx-a11y/*`, `unicorn/*`) → low.
  Unknown rules fall back to ESLint's severity floor.
- **Go (golangci-lint)** — tier by `FromLinter`: `gosec` → critical;
  `govet`/`staticcheck`/`typecheck`/`errorlint`/`ineffassign`/`unused`/
  `bodyclose`/`sqlclosecheck`/`noctx` → high; `errcheck`/`gocritic`/
  `revive`/`gocyclo`/`gosimple`/`unparam`/`gocognit` → medium; `gofmt`/
  `goimports`/`stylecheck`/`whitespace`/`misspell`/`lll` → low.
- **Rust (clippy)** — hand-catalogued correctness-group lints:
  15 memory-safety / UB lints (`uninit_*`, `transmuting_null`, `cast_ref_to_mut`,
  `invalid_atomic_ordering`, …) → critical; 35+ correctness-bug lints
  (`panicking_unwrap`, `never_loop`, `out_of_bounds_indexing`,
  `ifs_same_cond`, `logic_bug`, …) → high; rustc-native lints → medium;
  all other clippy groups (style, perf, pedantic, nursery, cargo) → low.
- **C#** — `mapLintSeverity` intentionally omitted: `dotnet-format` is
  a formatter, not a tiered linter. Documented in pack source with a
  TODO pointer to a future `dotnet build --verbosity quiet` integration
  that would extract CS*/CA*/IDE* diagnostic codes.

#### Dep-vuln aggregation across language packs

- **`mergeMetrics` now sums `depVuln*` counts** instead of overwriting.
  Mixed-stack repos (e.g. Node + Python) previously had whichever pack
  ran last silently clobber earlier packs' vuln counts. Now pip-audit
  and npm-audit findings add together. `depAuditTool` likewise joins
  with `, ` (e.g. `"pip-audit, npm-audit"`).
- **Meta-tool classifier fix** — `src/analyzers/security/*.ts` files
  matched `CRITICAL_PATTERNS` by name (`/security/i`) and showed up in
  test-gaps as critical untested code. They're analyzer modules, not
  app security code. Added path-prefix exception (`^src/analyzers/`,
  `^tmp/`, `^scripts/`) that downgrades these to their structural tier.
- **C# dotnet-format violations** reclassified from `lintErrors` to
  `lintWarnings` — they're formatting issues (indentation, spacing),
  not correctness errors. No longer inflates the quality/slop error
  count.

#### Async language-pack contract

- **`gatherMetrics` is now async** (`Promise<Partial<HealthMetrics>>`).
  Enables network-dependent enrichment (OSV lookups). The full analyzer
  chain — `analyzeHealth`, `analyzeQuality`, and the CLI commands —
  threads async end-to-end. Bonus: the 5 language packs now run through
  `Promise.all` in health.ts instead of sequentially.
- **`timedAsync`** helper added alongside existing `timed` in
  `src/analyzers/tools/timing.ts` for per-tool verbose timing of
  async gatherers.

### Changed

- **`vitest.config.ts`** now generates Istanbul summary + JSON reporters when
  `--coverage` is passed. Coverage output in `coverage/`.
- **Signal precedence in `test-gaps`** — coverage artifact now *overrides*
  filename match for files it measured. Previously all three signals OR'd
  together, which wrongly credited files like `cli.ts` when a test had a
  similar basename but didn't actually import the module. Now: artifact
  authoritative where present, import-graph for files it didn't see,
  filename-match as last resort.
- **`.husky/pre-push`** — now runs `npm run build && vitest run --coverage &&
  bash scripts/check-coverage.sh`. Previously ran `vitest run --changed @{u}`
  without coverage.
- **`--json` output** — clean JSON on stdout now. Previously the logger
  header (`━━━ vyuh-dxkit ...`) leaked into stdout before the JSON payload.

### Fixed

- **`--json` stdout pollution** — `logger.header/info/success/warn/fail/dim/
  detected` route to stderr when JSON mode is active.
- **Filename matcher false positives** — `cli-init.test.ts` used to credit
  `cli.ts` via basename similarity even though it doesn't import it in
  process (uses `execFileSync`). After the precedence fix and import-graph
  matcher, dxkit's `test-gaps` agrees with V8 on every measured file.
- **Unused import warnings** — cleaned up six pre-existing unused imports
  that CI's `--max-warnings 0` would now catch.

### Internal / Architecture

- New modules: `src/analyzers/tools/coverage.ts`, `tools/suppressions.ts`,
  `tests/import-graph.ts`.
- `HealthMetrics.coveragePercent` now populated from the imported artifact
  when present; the existing Testing-dimension coverage bonus fires against
  line-level truth instead of being null.
- `HealthMetrics.secretSuppressed` — count of gitleaks findings filtered by
  `.dxkit-suppressions.json`.
- `ToolDefinition.nodePackage` — optional field for Node packages detected
  via `node_modules/<pkg>/package.json` rather than a binary in `.bin`.
- `vitest.integration.config.ts` — separate config for running only the
  `test/integration/**` suite (kept for developers who want to run the slow
  integration tests without the rest of the suite).

## [1.5.1] - 2026-04-10

### Fixed
- **`make setup` no longer aborts on npm install failure.** Peer dependency
  conflicts now show a helpful message instead of killing the entire script.
- **`--stealth` flag** for `dxkit init` — gitignore only files created in
  this run.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-04-10

### Fixed
- **Node version detection** no longer returns the minimum from
  `engines.node` ranges. `">=10"` previously returned `10`; now
  prefers the installed Node version. Exact pins (`"^20"`, `"20"`)
  still work directly. Priority: `.nvmrc` > `volta.node` >
  `engines.node` (exact pin) > installed version > range minimum >
  default.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-04-09

### Added
- **`.project.yaml` config source.** When `.project.yaml` exists in the
  target directory (typically written by `@vyuhlabs/create-devstack`),
  `dxkit init` reads it and uses it as the config source — skipping
  both `detect()` and interactive prompts. This enables greenfield
  projects where no language files exist yet. If the file is malformed
  or missing `project.name`, dxkit falls back to detection + prompts.
- **Library exports**: `hasProjectYaml()` and `readProjectYaml()` from
  the `@vyuhlabs/dxkit` package entry point.
- **README**: `.project.yaml` documentation, library API section, and
  config source priority.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-04-09

### Added
- **Library entry point** (`src/lib.ts`). Exports `detect()`,
  `processTemplate()`, `TemplateEngine`, and `DetectedStack` for
  programmatic consumption by downstream packages like
  `@vyuhlabs/create-devstack`. The npm `exports` and `main` fields now
  point to `dist/lib.js` so `import { detect } from '@vyuhlabs/dxkit'`
  works. The CLI binary (`vyuh-dxkit`) is unaffected.
- **Path-scoped auto-activation** (`paths:` frontmatter) on four shipped
  skills, so they auto-load whenever Claude Code is touching a matching
  file — even if the user's prompt doesn't name the tool:
  - `gcloud` — `**/cloudbuild.{yaml,yml}`, `**/.gcloudignore`, `**/app.yaml`
  - `pulumi` — `Pulumi.{yaml,yml}` and stack variants
  - `secrets` — `**/.env*`, `**/.infisical.json`
  - `test` — common test file patterns across TypeScript, JavaScript,
    Go, Python (`**/*.test.*`, `**/*_test.go`, `**/test_*.py`,
    `**/__tests__/**`, `**/tests/**`)

  This is additive — descriptions still drive activation for everything
  else, and the eight intent-driven skills (`build`, `deploy`, `doctor`,
  `learned`, `quality`, `review`, `scaffold`, `session`) remain
  description-only, since path-scoping would over- or under-trigger them.
- **Test suite** (Vitest). Unit tests for `detect()` against fixture project
  trees, plus an integration test that runs the built CLI against a tmp dir
  and asserts on the generated `.claude/` tree.
- **Lint + format toolchain.** ESLint flat config with `typescript-eslint`,
  Prettier, and `eslint-config-prettier`. CI enforces both with
  `--max-warnings 0`.
- **Git hooks** via husky + lint-staged. Pre-commit auto-fixes staged files
  and runs `tsc --noEmit`. Pre-push runs affected tests
  (`vitest run --changed @{u}`) with a graceful fallback to the full suite.
- **`.git-blame-ignore-revs`** so formatting commits don't pollute blame.

### Changed
- **GitHub Actions Node version bumped from 20 → 22** in both `ci.yml` and
  `publish.yml`. Removes the Node 20 deprecation warning ahead of the
  2026-06-02 runner cutoff. `.nvmrc` updated to match. The package's
  `engines.node: ">=18"` constraint is unchanged — consumers on Node 18+
  are unaffected.
- **One-time Prettier baseline** applied across the existing source. The
  baseline commit is registered in `.git-blame-ignore-revs`.

### Fixed
- Removed three unused-variable / unused-import dead-code spots in
  `src/generator.ts` and `src/codebase-scanner.ts` that ESLint flagged.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-04-06

### Fixed
- Add missing `repository`, `homepage`, `bugs`, and `author` fields to
  `package.json` so npmjs.com surfaces a "Repository" link to
  https://github.com/vyuh-labs/dxkit. These fields were accidentally
  omitted from the 1.2.0 publish during the repo split.
- Include `LICENSE` and `CHANGELOG.md` in the published tarball.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-04-06

### Changed
- **Repository moved** to its own home at https://github.com/vyuh-labs/dxkit.
  Previously developed inside `vyuh-labs/codespaces-ai-template-v2`. The npm
  package name (`@vyuhlabs/dxkit`) is unchanged — `npx @vyuhlabs/dxkit init`
  works exactly as before.
- Package is now self-contained: templates live in `src-templates/` inside the
  repo instead of being copied from a parent monorepo at build time.

### Added
- `LICENSE` (MIT), `CHANGELOG.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- GitHub Actions: `ci.yml` (typecheck + build + pack-dry on push/PR) and
  `publish.yml` (publish to npm on GitHub release).

## [1.1.0] - 2026-04-06

### Added
- Strategic planner and plan executor agents (reports → KPIs → plans → execution).
- Feature development loop: `feature-planner` and `feature-builder` agents.
- Pattern-based tasks in the planner; pattern sweep in the plan executor.
- Stealth mode, dashboard, and expanded command/agent set (26 commands, 12 agents).

## [1.0.0] - 2026-03

### Added
- Initial public release of `@vyuhlabs/dxkit`.
- `init` command with auto-detect for languages and frameworks.
- Drop-in `.claude/` generation: agents, commands, skills, rules, settings.
- `--full` mode that also seeds devcontainer, Makefile, CI, and project scripts.
- `doctor` and `update` commands.
