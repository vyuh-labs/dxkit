## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- Package is now self-contained: templates live in `src-templates/` inside the
  package instead of being copied from a parent monorepo at build time. This
  is a prerequisite for extracting the package into its own repository.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-04-06

### Added
- Strategic planner and plan executor agents (reports → KPIs → plans → execution).
- Feature development loop: `feature-planner` and `feature-builder` agents.
- Pattern-based tasks in the planner; pattern sweep in the plan executor.
- Stealth mode, dashboard, and expanded command/agent set (26 commands, 12 agents).

## [1.0.0] - 2026-03

### Added
- Initial public release of `@vyuhlabs/dxkit`.
- `init` command with auto-detect for languages and frameworks.
- Drop-in `.claude/` generation: agents, commands, skills, rules, settings.
- `--full` mode that also seeds devcontainer, Makefile, CI, and project scripts.
- `doctor` and `update` commands.
