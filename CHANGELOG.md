# Changelog

All notable changes to `@vyuhlabs/dxkit` are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Path-scoped auto-activation** (`paths:` frontmatter) on four shipped
  skills, so they auto-load whenever Claude Code is touching a matching
  file — even if the user's prompt doesn't name the tool:
  - `gcloud` — `**/cloudbuild.{yaml,yml}`, `**/.gcloudignore`, `**/app.yaml`
  - `pulumi` — `Pulumi.{yaml,yml}` and stack variants
  - `secrets` — `**/.env*`, `**/.infisical.json`
  - `test` — common test file patterns across TypeScript, JavaScript,
    Go, Python (`**/*.test.*`, `**/*_test.go`, `**/test_*.py`,
    `**/__tests__/**`, `**/tests/**`)

  This is additive — descriptions still drive activation for everything
  else, and the eight intent-driven skills (`build`, `deploy`, `doctor`,
  `learned`, `quality`, `review`, `scaffold`, `session`) remain
  description-only, since path-scoping would over- or under-trigger them.
- **Test suite** (Vitest). Unit tests for `detect()` against fixture project
  trees, plus an integration test that runs the built CLI against a tmp dir
  and asserts on the generated `.claude/` tree.
- **Lint + format toolchain.** ESLint flat config with `typescript-eslint`,
  Prettier, and `eslint-config-prettier`. CI enforces both with
  `--max-warnings 0`.
- **Git hooks** via husky + lint-staged. Pre-commit auto-fixes staged files
  and runs `tsc --noEmit`. Pre-push runs affected tests
  (`vitest run --changed @{u}`) with a graceful fallback to the full suite.
- **`.git-blame-ignore-revs`** so formatting commits don't pollute blame.

### Changed
- **GitHub Actions Node version bumped from 20 → 22** in both `ci.yml` and
  `publish.yml`. Removes the Node 20 deprecation warning ahead of the
  2026-06-02 runner cutoff. `.nvmrc` updated to match. The package's
  `engines.node: ">=18"` constraint is unchanged — consumers on Node 18+
  are unaffected.
- **One-time Prettier baseline** applied across the existing source. The
  baseline commit is registered in `.git-blame-ignore-revs`.

### Fixed
- Removed three unused-variable / unused-import dead-code spots in
  `src/generator.ts` and `src/codebase-scanner.ts` that ESLint flagged.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-04-06

### Fixed
- Add missing `repository`, `homepage`, `bugs`, and `author` fields to
  `package.json` so npmjs.com surfaces a "Repository" link to
  https://github.com/vyuh-labs/dxkit. These fields were accidentally
  omitted from the 1.2.0 publish during the repo split.
- Include `LICENSE` and `CHANGELOG.md` in the published tarball.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-04-06

### Changed
- **Repository moved** to its own home at https://github.com/vyuh-labs/dxkit.
  Previously developed inside `vyuh-labs/codespaces-ai-template-v2`. The npm
  package name (`@vyuhlabs/dxkit`) is unchanged — `npx @vyuhlabs/dxkit init`
  works exactly as before.
- Package is now self-contained: templates live in `src-templates/` inside the
  repo instead of being copied from a parent monorepo at build time.

### Added
- `LICENSE` (MIT), `CHANGELOG.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- GitHub Actions: `ci.yml` (typecheck + build + pack-dry on push/PR) and
  `publish.yml` (publish to npm on GitHub release).

## [1.1.0] - 2026-04-06

### Added
- Strategic planner and plan executor agents (reports → KPIs → plans → execution).
- Feature development loop: `feature-planner` and `feature-builder` agents.
- Pattern-based tasks in the planner; pattern sweep in the plan executor.
- Stealth mode, dashboard, and expanded command/agent set (26 commands, 12 agents).

## [1.0.0] - 2026-03

### Added
- Initial public release of `@vyuhlabs/dxkit`.
- `init` command with auto-detect for languages and frameworks.
- Drop-in `.claude/` generation: agents, commands, skills, rules, settings.
- `--full` mode that also seeds devcontainer, Makefile, CI, and project scripts.
- `doctor` and `update` commands.
