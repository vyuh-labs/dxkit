## [Unreleased]

## [1.2.0] - 2026-04-06

### Changed
- **Repository moved** to its own home at https://github.com/vyuh-labs/dxkit.
  Previously developed inside `vyuh-labs/codespaces-ai-template-v2`. The npm
  package name (`@vyuhlabs/dxkit`) is unchanged — `npx @vyuhlabs/dxkit init`
  works exactly as before.
- Package is now self-contained: templates live in `src-templates/` inside the
  repo instead of being copied from a parent monorepo at build time.

### Added
- `LICENSE` (MIT), `CHANGELOG.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- GitHub Actions: `ci.yml` (typecheck + build + pack-dry on push/PR) and
  `publish.yml` (publish to npm on GitHub release).

## [1.1.0] - 2026-04-06

### Added
- Strategic planner and plan executor agents (reports → KPIs → plans → execution).
- Feature development loop: `feature-planner` and `feature-builder` agents.
- Pattern-based tasks in the planner; pattern sweep in the plan executor.
- Stealth mode, dashboard, and expanded command/agent set (26 commands, 12 agents).

## [1.0.0] - 2026-03

### Added
- Initial public release of `@vyuhlabs/dxkit`.
- `init` command with auto-detect for languages and frameworks.
- Drop-in `.claude/` generation: agents, commands, skills, rules, settings.
- `--full` mode that also seeds devcontainer, Makefile, CI, and project scripts.
- `doctor` and `update` commands.
